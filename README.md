# Common User Passwords Profiler (CUPP) 
CUPP is a powerful tool for generating a wordlist for brute force attacks. It's written in Python and hence cross-compatible with almost any platform capable of running Python scripts. To run, CUPP needs data about the target (their name, wife's name, pet's name, phone number, and so on), and it then generates passwords based on the keywords entered.
It can be used to generate custom wordlists for the red team and pentesting engagements.
